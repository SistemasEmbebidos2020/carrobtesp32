**Carrobtesp32**
================

A Python library for interacting with the Carrobtesp32 microcontroller, providing a simple and efficient way to control and monitor devices.

**Project Description**
------------------------

The carrobtesp32 repository is a collection of code snippets and utilities designed for developing applications on the Carrobtesp32 microcontroller. This project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly interface for interacting with the board's peripherals, making it easier to develop complex projects.

**Features**
------------

*   **Python Library**: The `iaia.py` file provides a Python API for interacting with the Carrobtesp32 microcontroller.
*   **C++ Example Code**: The `main.cpp` file demonstrates how to use the iaia library in a C++ project, providing a simple example of how to control the board's peripherals.

**Installation**
----------------

To get started with the carrobtesp32 repository:

1.  Clone the repository using Git: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/carrobtesp32.git`
2.  Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3.  Compile and upload the `main.cpp` example code to the Carrobtesp32 microcontroller using your preferred development environment.

**Usage**
----------

*   **Python Library**: Import the iaia library in your Python project by adding the following line at the top of your script:
    ```python
import iaia
```
    Use the provided functions to interact with the Carrobtesp32 microcontroller's peripherals.
*   **C++ Example Code**: Compile and upload the `main.cpp` example code to the Carrobtesp32 microcontroller. This will demonstrate how to use the iaia library in a C++ project.

**Project Structure**
---------------------

The carrobtesp32 repository is organized as follows:

*   `iaia.py`: Python library for interacting with the Carrobtesp32 microcontroller.
*   `main.cpp`: Example code demonstrating how to use the iaia library in a C++ project.
*   `README.md`: This file.

**Requirements**
----------------

*   **Python 3.x**: The iaia library is written in Python and requires at least version 3.x to run.
*   **Carrobtesp32 Microcontroller**: The Carrobtesp32 microcontroller is required for this project. Ensure you have the latest firmware installed.
